# Framework French Cleat Mount
 Framework French Cleat Mount

Mount your Framework motherboard to anything with this french cleat wall mount. 

The current setup is designed to mount to a wall. That is how i've used it though with the included STEP file you can modify the mount to add the french cleat bar to mount to anything you'd like. 

Feel free to remix/mod to fit your needs.
